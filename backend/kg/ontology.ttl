    rdfs:label "Watchlist" ;

    fpl:userGoal "Maximize gameweek points" .

# =============================================================
# INFERRED CLASSES (OWL Reasoning)
# Enhanced with Design Rationale per Glushko's TDO
# =============================================================

# Captain Candidate: form >= 7.0 AND status = 'a'
fpl:CaptainCandidate a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Captain Candidate" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Player with form >= 7.0 and available status" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Captain choice doubles points, making it the highest-leverage decision each GW. We identify players combining high recent form (7+) with full availability to minimize risk of a captain blank." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Select optimal captain for maximum points" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "form >= 7.0 AND status = 'available'" .

# Transfer Target: form >= 5.0 AND points/price >= 12
fpl:TransferTarget a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Transfer Target" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: High-value transfer target" ;
    fpl:designRationale "With limited free transfers, users need to identify players offering both current form AND long-term value. This class balances immediate performance with points-per-million efficiency." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Identify worthwhile transfer targets" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "form >= 5.0 AND (totalPoints / price) >= 12" .

# Differential Pick: ownership < 10% AND form >= 5.0
fpl:DifferentialPick a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Differential Pick" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Low ownership with good form" ;
    fpl:designRationale "To climb ranks in FPL, users need players that score well but aren't owned by rivals. Differentials provide rank gains when they score. We filter for form >= 5 to avoid 'differential for differential's sake'." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Find rank-climbing opportunities" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "ownership < 10% AND form >= 5.0" .

# Rotation Risk: minutes < 800 AND price > 6
fpl:RotationRisk a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Rotation Risk" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Player at risk of rotation" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Expensive players who don't play regularly represent poor value and risk 1-point cameos. This flags premium players with concerning minute counts, often due to manager rotation policies." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Avoid unreliable starters" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "minutes < 800 AND price > 6.0" .

# Value Pick: points/price >= 15
fpl:ValuePick a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Value Pick" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: High points per million" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Budget management is crucial in FPL. Value picks free up funds for premium players elsewhere. A threshold of 15 pts/£m identifies players significantly outperforming their price bracket." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Maximize squad value efficiency" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "(totalPoints / price) >= 15" .

# Premium Asset: price >= 10 AND form >= 6
fpl:PremiumAsset a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Premium Asset" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Expensive but justified player" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Premium players (£10m+) consume significant budget. This class validates that expensive assets are currently performing, distinguishing between 'premium and firing' vs 'premium and blanking'." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Validate premium player investment" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "price >= 10.0 AND form >= 6.0" .

# Injury Concern: status != 'a' OR chance < 75
fpl:InjuryConcern a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Injury Concern" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Player with injury doubts" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Injured players score 0 points. This class aggregates all availability concerns from FPL's status flags and chance-of-playing percentages, enabling users to assess squad health at a glance." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Monitor squad availability risks" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "status != 'available' OR chanceOfPlaying < 75" .

# Form Differential: form > ppg + 2
fpl:FormDifferential a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Form Differential" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Player outperforming expectations" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Players whose recent form significantly exceeds their season average may be entering a purple patch. This temporal comparison identifies momentum that raw form scores miss." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Identify players gaining momentum" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "form > (pointsPerGame + 2)" .

# Must Buy: form >= 6 AND easy fixtures AND rising
fpl:MustBuy a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Must Buy" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Essential transfer target" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Combines multiple positive signals: current form, favorable upcoming fixtures, and rising ownership (indicating market consensus). These players have the strongest buy case." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Identify highest-priority transfers" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "form >= 6.0 AND avgFDR <= 2.5 AND transfersIn > transfersOut" .

# Sell Urgent: form < 3 OR injured OR tough fixtures
fpl:SellUrgent a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Sell Urgent" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Should sell immediately" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Identifies players who are actively harming squad performance through poor form, unavailability, or difficult fixtures. Prioritizes which players to remove first." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Identify highest-priority sales" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "form < 3.0 OR status != 'available' OR avgFDR >= 4.0" .

# =============================================================
# SMARTPLAY-BASED INFERRED CLASSES
# These use ML-derived SmartPlay scores for more accurate classification
# =============================================================

# Top Player: smartplay >= 7.0
fpl:TopPlayer a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Top Player" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: High SmartPlay score indicating top-tier performer" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Uses ML composite score combining form, nailedness, and fixtures to identify consistently strong picks." ;

    fpl:inferenceRule "smartplayScore >= 7.0" .

# Form Player: form_pts >= 7.0 OR form_xg >= 7.0
fpl:FormPlayer a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Form Player" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Strong recent form based on points or expected goals" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Captures players performing well whether through actual points or underlying stats (xG/xA)." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Identify players in good form" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "formPtsScore >= 7.0 OR formXgScore >= 7.0" .

# Fixture Friendly: fixture >= 7.0
fpl:FixtureFriendly a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Fixture Friendly" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Favorable upcoming fixtures" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Players with easy upcoming fixtures have higher expected returns. Key for transfer planning." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Plan transfers around fixture swings" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "fixtureScore >= 7.0" .

# Nailed On: nailedness >= 9.0
fpl:NailedOn a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf fpl:Player ;
    rdfs:label "Nailed On" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Extremely high nailedness - guaranteed starter" ;
    fpl:designRationale "Players who play 90 minutes virtually every game provide consistent floor of points. Critical for set-and-forget picks." ;
    fpl:userGoal "Find reliable starters" ;
    fpl:inferenceRule "nailednessScore >= 9.0" .

# Premium (replaces PremiumAsset with SmartPlay logic)
fpl:Premium a owl:Class ;

    rdfs:label "Premium" ;
    rdfs:comment "Inferred: Expensive premium with justified SmartPlay score" ;

    fpl:inferenceRule "price >= 10.0 AND smartplayScore >= 6.5" .
