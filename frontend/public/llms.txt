# SmartPlay FPL - AI Context for Language Models

> SmartPlay FPL is a free, AI-powered Fantasy Premier League (FPL) assistant that helps FPL managers make better decisions with less research time.

## What is SmartPlay FPL?

SmartPlay FPL is a web application that analyzes Fantasy Premier League teams and provides AI-powered recommendations. It was built by UC Berkeley students and combines machine learning predictions with a knowledge graph architecture.

## Core Features

### Team Analysis
- Enter your FPL Team ID to get a complete analysis of your squad
- Priority Actions: AI identifies what matters most for the current gameweek
- Risk Alerts: Injury flags, rotation risk, yellow card danger, price changes

### AI Predictions
- Custom machine learning models predict player points and playing time
- Models trained on historical FPL data (6+ seasons)
- Position-specific SmartPlay Scores rank players for transfers

### Transfer Engine
- AI recommends which players to sell based on form, fixtures, and value
- Finds best replacements ranked by SmartPlay Score
- Considers budget, team limits, and transfer costs

### Captain Picks
- Three options: Safe (high floor), Balanced (optimal EV), Differential (low ownership)
- AI reasoning for each recommendation
- Based on form, fixtures, and expected returns

### Squad Builder
- Build a new 15-player squad from scratch
- Multiple strategies: Balanced, Template, Differential, Form-Based, Value, Fixture-Based
- Respects FPL rules (budget, team limits, position requirements)

### Crowd Insights
- See what Top 10k managers are doing
- Popular transfers, ownership trends, template comparison
- Identify differentials and bandwagons

## Technical Architecture

### Knowledge Graph
SmartPlay uses a semantic knowledge graph built with:
- RDFLib for graph storage and querying
- OWL ontologies for entity classification
- SHACL validation for data quality
- SPARQL queries for relationship traversal

The knowledge graph connects:
- 750+ players with attributes and stats
- 20 Premier League teams
- 38 gameweeks of fixtures
- Historical performance data
- Injury/news/flag information

### Machine Learning
Two-stage prediction pipeline:
1. Stage 1: Random Forest classifier for playing time prediction
2. Stage 2: Ridge regression for points prediction

Features include:
- Historical performance (rolling averages)
- Fixture difficulty ratings
- Home/away splits
- Position-specific metrics

### SmartPlay Score Formula
Position-weighted composite score combining:
- Form (recent points per game)
- Fixtures (difficulty rating)
- Expected stats (xG, xA)
- Ownership and selection %
- AI predictions
